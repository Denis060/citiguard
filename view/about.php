        <h3>Message from the Founder</h3>
        <p>“I started CitiGuard because I’ve seen firsthand how fear, silence, and injustice affect ordinary people. This platform is not about fighting the police—it’s about fighting corruption and restoring dignity to every citizen. We’re building this together, one report at a time.”<br><br><strong>– Ibrahim Denis Fofanah</strong></p>
